(1) Collect data to which applying an autoregression might make sense. Explain why autoregression might be a good fit for the data. Use an AR(1) and and an AR(optimal) model to predict the data and display the original data and predicted values in a time series chart. Check if the AIC and BIC criteria both result in the same number of lags for the AR(optimal) model. 

(2) Hide the end of the data set and forecast the series using the different models. Decide which model you would use and explain why.

(3) Add one other independent variable to the model and compare the forecasts of this updated model to the previous ones.
