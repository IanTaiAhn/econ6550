1) Collect data from a reputable source in order use both a simple regression and multiple regression to make prediction and generate prediction intervals in a Colab notebook. You can collect multiple independent variables, or you can "make" the extra independent variable by using a time trend like the video, interactions, or categorical variables. Do not use simulated data for this assignment. Motivate your analysis by explaining why someone might be interested in predicting the dependent variable you use. Please reach out to me if you need to brainstorm data to collect. Come up with some interesting sets of independent variables to make predictions with, and present both the point prediction and associated prediction interval. 

(2) Make a plot showing the predicted regression line from your simple regression with the dependent variable on the y-axis and independent variable on the x-axis. Also display prediction interval lines. (The easiest way to do this is probably starting by generating x-values from x-min to x-max, then getting predicted y's for that set. Then generate lower and upper prediction interval bounds for each x in the set. Note that the statistics, e.g., /bar_x, should still be calculated using the collected data.)
