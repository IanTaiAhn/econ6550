(1) Show that applying the difference-in-differences regression, <equation>, on a sample of just Utah and Colorado, where <y_it> is the crime rate, and treatment is recreational marijuana legalization, will give <equation>
from the Treatment Effect lecture. You will need to start by noting things like beta_0 = the average crime rate in Utah before Colorado legalized marijuana,
... Simulate data associated with this example.

(2) Simulate or collect data that may suffer from an endogeneity issue. Explain the endogeneity issue. Compare the outcomes of a 2SLS model a Two-Stage Machine Learning model and discuss the similarities and differences. If there are no differences, explain why that is.
