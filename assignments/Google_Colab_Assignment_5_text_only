(1) Collect data on two variables for a simple linear regression that you believe have a linear relationship and may violate the homoscedasticity and/or no autocorrelation assumption. Create a scatter plot of the data. Comment on whether the scatter plot indicates an issues of heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation. Estimate the parameters of the linear regression model using OLS and some type of GLS. Compare and contrast the results. 

(2) A linear probability model (LPM) is a linear regression model with a binomial categorical dependent variable. Rigorously argue that all LPMs suffer from heteroscedasticity using a simulation or mathematical logic.
