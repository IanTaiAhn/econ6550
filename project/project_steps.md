### Tenative Project Outline (copilot assisted)

🧪 Step 1: Define Your Model
Let’s denote:
𝑌: Conversion Rate (dependent variable)
𝐷: Clicks (endogenous regressor)
𝑋: Exogenous controls (Age, Gender, Income, Location, Ad Type, Ad Topic, Ad Placement, CTR)
𝑍: Instrument(s) for Clicks

Your structural equation is:
𝑌=𝛼+𝛽𝐷+𝛾𝑋+𝜖

But since 𝐷 is endogenous, you need an instrument 𝑍 such that:
𝑍 is correlated with 𝐷
𝑍 is not correlated with 𝜖
(the error term in the conversion equation)

🧠 Step 2: Engineer Instruments (Z) Using ML
This is where machine learning shines. You can construct instruments from high-dimensional features using ML models:

🔹 Examples of ML-generated IVs:
Predict clicks using a random forest or gradient boosting model trained on:

Ad Type, Ad Topic, Ad Placement

User demographics (Age, Gender, Income, Location)

Time features from Click Time (e.g., hour, day of week)

Use the predicted clicks𝐷^(dhat) as your instrument

This satisfies the relevance condition (predicts clicks), and if the model excludes direct predictors of conversion (e.g., CTR), it may satisfy the exclusion restriction.

🧮 Step 3: Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
🔹 First Stage:
Estimate predicted clicks using your instrument:
𝐷=𝜋0+𝜋1𝑍+𝜋2X+𝜈

🔹 Second Stage:
Use predicted clicks to estimate conversion rate:
𝑌=𝛼+𝛽𝐷^+𝛾𝑋+𝜖

This gives you a de-biased estimate of the causal effect of clicks on conversion rate.

📊 Step 4: Value-Added Estimation
You can extend this by estimating value-added effects of different ad features or placements:

Group ads by type/topic/placement

Estimate their contribution to conversion rate after controlling for user features and predicted clicks

This isolates the incremental impact of ad design choices—your "value-added"

🔹 Example:
Let’s say you want to estimate the value-added of Video ads on Social Media:

Include interaction terms (Ad Type × Ad Placement)

Use fixed effects or random effects to capture group-level contributions

Apply 2SLS to correct for endogenous clicks

🧠 Bonus: Double Machine Learning (DML)
If you want to go further:

Use ML to estimate nuisance functions (e.g., propensity scores, outcome models)

Orthogonalize residuals to remove bias

Estimate the treatment effect of clicks robustly

✅ Feasibility & Next Steps
This is absolutely feasible and cutting-edge. You’re combining:

Causal inference (2SLS)

ML for instrument construction

Value-added estimation for ad design impact

Would you like help sketching out the code in Python or R, or designing the validation strategy (e.g., placebo tests, overidentification checks)?
