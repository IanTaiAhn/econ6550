Nice:
Clicks are messy because people who click are already more likely to buy.
Instrumental variables let you isolate the part of clicks that comes from ad mechanics (placement, type, timing)
rather than user intent.
2SLS uses that clean variation to estimate the true causal effect of clicks on conversions.
Chetty’s insight: after you estimate, check if your model’s predictions line up with reality when conditions change. 
If not, you’ve got forecast bias.

My Question Back:
Well. What if the instrument created is too weak? Or say the instrument is strong enough, but the causal effect of the
predicted clicks is insignificant? Would it even be worht it to move onto the Chetty insight portion with forecast bias?
This is a really good “what if” question — it’s the kind of fork in the road that econometricians wrestle with all the 
time. Let’s break it down in plain terms:

1. If the instrument is too weak
Problem: A weak instrument means your first stage barely explains clicks.
Consequence: The 2SLS estimates become unreliable — they can be more biased than OLS and have huge standard errors.
Action: Don’t move forward. Instead, revisit instrument design:
Add stronger policy-side features (placement rules, timing shocks, randomized holdouts).
Check first-stage F-statistics (rule of thumb: >10 is “strong enough”).
Consider multiple instruments and test overidentification.

2. If the instrument is strong enough, but the causal effect is insignificant
Problem: You’ve got a valid instrument, but the estimated effect of clicks on conversions is statistically
indistinguishable from zero.
Consequence: That’s actually a result — it suggests clicks (at least the variation induced by your instrument) don’t 
causally drive conversions.
Action:
Report it honestly. It may mean ad clicks are just correlated with conversions, not causing them.
Explore heterogeneity: maybe the effect is zero overall but positive in certain segments 
(e.g., video ads in rural areas).
Consider whether your outcome variable (Conversion_Rate) is noisy or needs aggregation.

3. Should you still do the Chetty-style forecast bias test?
If the instrument is weak: No. Forecast bias checks rely on having a credible causal estimate to validate.
Without that, you’re just testing noise.
If the instrument is strong but the effect is insignificant: It depends:
If you want to validate predictive accuracy, you can still run forecast bias checks — but they’ll likely confirm that 
your model doesn’t add much causal signal.
If your goal is causal inference, then there’s little point in moving to forecast bias. The Chetty insight is about 
testing whether causal estimates are biased in prediction. If the causal effect itself is null, bias testing isn’t informative.

4. In plain words
Weak instrument → stop and redesign.
Strong instrument but no effect → that’s the finding. You can still check forecast bias if you care about prediction,
but it won’t rescue a null causal effect.
Chetty’s insight is only useful once you have a meaningful causal estimate to stress-test.

👉 Think of it like building a bridge:
If the foundation (instrument strength) is shaky, don’t bother testing how cars drive across it.
If the foundation is solid but the bridge leads nowhere (no causal effect), you can still test the road quality
(forecast bias), but the journey won’t be meaningful.
Would you like me to sketch out a diagnostic checklist (like a flowchart) you can run in your Jupyter workflow to decide
whether to proceed to forecast bias testing or stop at instrument diagnostics? That way you’ll have a reproducible 
decision rule.
