Part I: Empirical Limits with Real Data
Title idea: “The Endogeneity of Clicks: Limits of Instrumental Variable Approaches in Digital Advertising”

Motivation:
Clicks are widely used as a proxy for ad effectiveness, but they are endogenous (correlated with unobserved user intent).
OLS estimates are biased; IV/2SLS requires strong instruments.

Empirical setup:
Dataset: demographics, ad features, clicks, conversions.

Instruments tested: Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Ad_Topic, Day_of_Week.
ML feature engineering attempted to strengthen instruments.

Findings:
First-stage F-statistics are weak.
Correlation between predicted and actual clicks is near zero.
Even with ML, instruments remain weak.

Conclusion: In practice, observational ad data struggles to support IV inference.

Contribution:
Demonstrates the empirical difficulty of finding strong instruments in digital ads.
Provides diagnostics (Stock–Yogo, Cragg–Donald) as a cautionary tale for applied researchers.

##############################################################################################################

Part II: Conceptual Demonstration with Synthetic Data
Title idea: “Forecast Bias in Click-Based Measures: A Simulation Inspired by Chetty et al. (2014)”

Motivation:
Even if instruments were strong, are clicks unbiased forecasts of conversions?
Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education provides a template.

Synthetic design:
Generate data where clicks are endogenous to latent user interest.
Define ad “events” (e.g., placement/type changes) analogous to teacher turnover.
Compare forecasted conversions (based on clicks) to actual conversions.

Forecast bias test:
Calibration slope: regress actual conversions on predicted conversions.

Event-study validation: forecasted vs. realized changes when ad features shift.
Show systematic overprediction (e.g., flashy ads with high clicks but low conversions).

Findings:
OLS forecasts are biased (systematic misprediction).
2SLS forecasts correct bias when instruments are strong (in simulation).
Demonstrates how forecast bias manifests in ad settings.

Contribution:
Extends Chetty’s framework to digital advertising.
Provides a conceptual lens: clicks may mislead as forecasts, even beyond endogeneity.
Highlights the need for experimental variation in ad studies.

##############################################################################################################

Conclusion / Integration
Part I: Real-world ad data → instruments are weak, IV inference unreliable.

Part II: Synthetic data → forecast bias framework shows why clicks can mislead as forecasts.

Overall message:
Empirically: caution in using clicks as causal regressors.
Conceptually: clicks may suffer forecast bias, requiring better measures or experimental designs.
Managerial implication: don’t equate clicks with conversions; design studies to validate predictive measures.

🎯 Why this works
Part I grounds the paper in real data and shows the empirical challenge.
Part II elevates the paper by connecting to Chetty’s influential framework, even if synthetic.
Together, they tell a coherent story: “Clicks are endogenous and weakly instrumented in practice; conceptually,
they may also suffer forecast bias.”

🧾 Poster Abstract
Clicks, Instruments, and Forecast Bias: Evaluating Causal Inference in Digital Advertising

This study investigates the reliability of click-based measures in estimating and forecasting ad effectiveness. 
In Part I, we simulate ad impression data to compare Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
estimates of the causal effect of clicks on conversion rates. Using machine learning–engineered instruments derived
from ad features, we demonstrate that strong instruments can recover the true causal effect, while OLS suffers from 
endogeneity bias.

Part II: Forecast Bias in Click-Based Predictions Building on Raj Chetty’s (2014) forecast bias framework, we adapt the 
methodology to the advertising domain. Using synthetic data with a known causal structure, we examine whether 
click-based forecasts systematically mispredict conversion outcomes across ad configurations. Two validation exercises 
are conducted: (1) a calibration slope test, where OLS-based forecasts exhibit attenuation bias while 2SLS-based 
forecasts align more closely with the true causal effect; and (2) an event-style analysis, where simulated shocks to ad 
features reveal that OLS forecasts tend to overpredict conversion changes, while 2SLS forecasts reduce bias. Although 
the implementation is preliminary and subject to limitations, results suggest that instrumented approaches can correct 
systematic forecast bias in advertising contexts.

Together, these findings highlight the dual role of endogeneity: it distorts both causal inference and predictive 
validity. We conclude that clicks may be unreliable as forecasting measures unless instrumented properly, and we propose 
the forecast bias framework as a diagnostic tool for validating predictive metrics in digital advertising.



🟣 Introduction
Clicks are widely used to measure ad effectiveness, yet they are often endogenous — influenced by latent user intent and 
ad targeting. This endogeneity undermines causal inference and may distort predictions of conversion outcomes. Inspired 
by Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education, this study investigates whether clicks are reliable both as causal 
regressors and as forecasting tools in digital advertising.

🟣 Research Goal
Part I: Evaluate whether machine learning–enhanced instruments can recover the true causal effect of clicks on 
conversions using 2SLS.

Part II: Test whether click-based forecasts systematically mispredict conversion outcomes using Chetty-style validation 
techniques.

🟣 Methods
We simulate synthetic ad impression data with known causal structure:
Endogeneity: Clicks are influenced by latent user intent.
Instruments: Ad_Type × Ad_Placement combinations are used to predict clicks.
Outcome: Conversion_Rate is generated with a true causal effect of clicks.

Two models are fit:
OLS: Treats clicks as exogenous.
2SLS: Uses instruments to correct for endogeneity.

We apply two forecast bias diagnostics:
Calibration slope test: Regress actual conversion rates on predicted rates across ad cohorts.
Event-style validation: Simulate ad configuration “shocks” and compare forecasted vs. actual changes in conversion rates.

🟣 Figures and Results
Instrument strength: ML-enhanced instruments yield strong first-stage F-statistics.
Calibration slope:
OLS slope ≈ 0.32 → systematic overprediction.
2SLS slope ≈ 1.03 → unbiased forecasts.

Event-style validation:
OLS forecasts overshoot actual conversion changes.
2SLS forecasts align closely with observed outcomes.

These results demonstrate that 2SLS corrects both causal bias and forecast bias when instruments are strong.

🟣 Conclusion
This study shows that endogeneity in click data distorts both causal inference and predictive accuracy. 
While OLS overestimates conversion effects and mispredicts outcomes, 2SLS — when supported by strong instruments
 — recovers the true causal effect and produces calibrated forecasts. We adapt Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework
  to digital advertising, offering a diagnostic lens for validating predictive metrics in observational settings.

🟣 Introduction
Clicks are widely used to measure ad effectiveness, but they’re often endogenous — shaped by user intent and targeting. This undermines causal inference and may distort predictions. 
Inspired by Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education, we test whether clicks are reliable for both causal estimation and forecasting in digital advertising.

🟣 Research Goal
Part I: Estimate the causal effect of clicks on conversions using machine learning–enhanced instruments and 2SLS.

Part II: Diagnose forecast bias in click-based predictions using Chetty-style calibration and event-style validation.

🟣 Methods
We simulate synthetic ad impression data with known causal structure inspired by the original dataset:

Endogeneity: Clicks are influenced by latent user intent.
Instruments: Ad_Type × Ad_Placement combinations predict clicks.
Outcome: Conversion_Rate is generated with a true causal effect of clicks.

Two models are fit:

OLS: Treats clicks as exogenous.
2SLS: Uses instruments to correct for endogeneity.

Forecast bias diagnostics:

Calibration slope test: Regress actual conversion rates on predicted rates across ad cohorts.
Event-style validation: Simulate ad configuration “shocks” and compare forecasted vs. actual changes.

🟣 Figures and Results

Figures and Results Part 2:
“The calibration plot shows whether OLS and 2SLS forecasts are systematically biased across cohorts
 in the cross‑section. The event‑style validation goes further, simulating a shock to test whether 
 forecasts remain reliable under change. Both measure forecast bias, but calibration is static 
 while event validation is dynamic — together they mirror Chetty’s 2014 reliability framework of 
 subgroup calibration and event study validation.”

 Okay.
11/17/2025:
 Endogeneity in click data distorts both causal inference and predictive accuracy. OLS overestimates conversion effects 
 and mispredicts outcomes. 2SLS — when supported by strong instruments — recovers the true causal effect and produces 
 calibrated forecasts. To construct such instruments, we employ machine learning ensemble methods that combine multiple 
 predictors into a robust signal, strengthening identification and mitigating bias. We adapt Raj Chetty’s forecast bias 
 framework to digital advertising, offering a diagnostic lens for validating predictive metrics in observational settings.

 Alright. So I need to come up with a conclusion for this.
 In my own words...
 Due to the nature of the second part of this study being acheived through synthetic data generation no hard conclusions
 can be made, but that doesn't dismiss the pedagogical nature of this study. While the real data failed due to excessive 
 noise, and the "Click_time" column having little to no variation which lead to no meaningful predictors in the real dataset were 
 able to help predict the "Clicks" column to create an instrument.
 However, a real pipeline to create a ML based instrument leveraging off of preprocessing, interaction features, and ensemble
 modeling was implemented with great success. This ML-instrument was able to be used in an endogenity study where OLS
 failed and 2SLS succeeded, thus laying the groundwork for real implementation with real data.
 Further work and research will be required to fully implement Chetty's 2014 forecast bias techniques because while inspired,
 the calibration bias lacked the lagged variables, and the the event-style shocks were real exogneous shocks unlike the 
 simulated shock induced into the synthetic dataset.

 Claude Help:
Due to the nature of the second part of this study being achieved through synthetic data generation, no hard conclusions
can be made, but that doesn't dismiss the pedagogical value of this work. The real data failed due to excessive noise 
and minimal variation in the "Click_time" column, resulting in no meaningful predictors for instrumenting the "Clicks" 
column. This is due to the data collection of the column "Click_time" because the time stamp for every observation was 20:45,
with slight variation in microseconds.
However, a complete ML-based instrumental variable pipeline was successfully implemented, incorporating preprocessing, 
interaction features, and ensemble modeling. The F-statistic was well above 10, Stock-Yogo tests passed, and Cragg–Donald
statistic was high as well.
This ML-instrument demonstrated its utility in an endogeneity study where OLS failed and 2SLS succeeded, establishing a 
proof-of-concept for real-world implementation. Yet the circular reasoning here is concerning: if your instrument was 
constructed from the same noisy data that failed initially, how confident can we be in the 2SLS results?
Further work is required to fully implement Chetty's 2014 forecast bias techniques. While inspired by his framework, 
the calibration bias estimation lacked the crucial lagged variables, and the event-style shocks were genuine exogenous
 shocks—unlike the simulated shock artificially induced into the synthetic dataset. 
 
 This synthetic-to-real gap is more
  than a limitation; it's a fundamental validity concern that undermines claims about establishing "groundwork for real 
  implementation."


Key issues: What are your first-stage F-statistics? How do you address the weak instrument problem? Without validation 
metrics, this reads more like methodological exercise than applied research.


Due to the nature of the second part of this study being achieved through synthetic data generation, no hard conclusions
can be made, but that doesn't dismiss the pedagogical value of this work. This study showed that ML may be combined with IV
instrumentation and in theory works in reducing endogeneity. The real data failed due to excessive noise 
and minimal variation in the "Click_time" column, resulting in no meaningful predictors for instrumenting the "Clicks"
column. Specifically, the data collection process captured all observations at timestamp 20:45 with only 
microsecond-level variation. This clear data quality issue rendered the variable unusable as an instrument. 
This represents a fundamental flaw in the original data collection design rather than a theoretical limitation.
However, a complete ML-based instrumental variable pipeline was successfully implemented on synthetic data, 
incorporating preprocessing, interaction features, and ensemble modeling. The first-stage F-statistic exceeded 10, 
Stock-Yogo weak instrument tests were passed, and the Cragg-Donald statistic confirmed instrument strength. While these 
diagnostics are encouraging, they validate only the synthetic implementation. This ML-instrument demonstrated its utility
in an endogeneity study where OLS failed and 2SLS succeeded, establishing a proof-of-concept for the methodological 
pipeline even though endoegneity was baked into the synthetic data.
"On the flip-side, this study may also serve as validation that garbage in, garbage out rings true. No amount
of ML feature engineering can create a strong instrument from weak predictors."
"The critical limitation remains: the synthetic data was designed to produce these results. The instrument worked because
the data generation process embedded the necessary relationships—when applied to real data with weak predictors, 
no amount of ML feature engineering could manufacture a valid instrument. This serves as empirical validation of the 
'garbage in, garbage out' principle in causal inference.""

Further work is required to fully implement Chetty's 2014 forecast bias techniques. While inspired by his framework, 
the calibration bias estimation lacked the crucial lagged variables, and the event-style shocks where genuine exogenous 
shocks—unlike the simulated shock artificially induced into the synthetic dataset. Future research should prioritize 
either: (1) re-collecting real data with proper temporal variation, or (2) validating this approach on existing datasets 
with known endogeneity where traditional instruments have succeeded, to benchmark the ML approach against established 
methods.

The critical limitation remains unaddressed: the synthetic data was designed to produce these results. The instrument 
worked because the data generation process embedded the necessary relationships, not because the methodology would 
necessarily identify valid instruments in authentic datasets with unknown data-generating processes. You've demonstrated 
technical competency in implementing 2SLS with ML-based instruments, but haven't demonstrated that this approach solves 
real endogeneity problems. The failed real data attempt suggests the opposite—that when predictive relationships are weak
 or absent, no amount of ML feature engineering can manufacture a valid instrument.

### split up the paragraphs...###
The first attempt to implement IV with machine learning techniques failed due to fatal data quality issues in the 
real-world dataset. The cause was excessive noise and minimal variation in the "Click_time" column, resulting in no 
meaningful predictors for instrumenting the "Clicks"
column. Specifically, the data collection process captured all observations at timestamp 20:45 with only 
microsecond-level variation. This clear data quality issue rendered the variable unusable as an instrument. 
This represents a fundamental flaw in the original data collection design rather than a theoretical limitation.
No amount of ML feature engineering could manufacture a valid instrument and so this serves as empirical validation 
of the 'garbage in, garbage out' principle in causal inference.
While this is a valid outcome on its own, there was still curiosity in how data with valid predictors and endogenous variables
would take an instrument created from ML techniques.
To allow the study to continue synthetic data was generated with endogeneity baked into the "Clicks" predictor 
and the columns used in the real dataset were used again albeit synthetically created.

Endogeneity was introduced by correlating the error term with 'Clicks' (ρ = 0.08), simulating omitted variable bias to 
test whether 2SLS could recover unbiased estimates where OLS would fail. A complete ML-based instrumental variable pipeline was successfully implemented on the data, 
incorporating preprocessing, interaction features, and ensemble modeling. The first-stage F-statistic came out to 1744,
which far exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 10 and the Cragg-Donald statistic confirmed instrument strength.
While these diagnostics are encouraging, they validate only the synthetic implementation. 
This ML-instrument demonstrated its utility in an endogeneity study where OLS failed and 2SLS succeeded, 
establishing a proof-of-concept for the methodological pipeline.
This success allowed the study to continue to its other intended research purpose of incorporating Chetty like calibration
bias, and event-style shock events. While inspired by his framework the implementation suffered from major issues.
The calibration bias estimation lacked the crucial lagged variables, and the event-style shocks were genuine exogenous in Chetty's study
unlike the simulated shock artificially induced into the synthetic dataset. The biggest issue was that the data used was 
synthetic, and in Chetty's study there were millions of rows that were real, based on tax documents, school districts, and such.
Overall, the two main takeaways from this study are these. Instruments created by machine learning techniques should be
validated and tested on real proven datasets so that ML created IVs may be validated against established IV creation methods.
Chetty's techniques should be implemented with stricter terms in order to re-create a more accurate exploration of his 
2014 study. Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates the technical feasibility of integrating ML feature 
engineering into the first-stage IV estimation, suggesting a promising avenue for instrument construction when combined 
with appropriate data quality and validation protocols.
