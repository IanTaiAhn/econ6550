Part I: Empirical Limits with Real Data
Title idea: “The Endogeneity of Clicks: Limits of Instrumental Variable Approaches in Digital Advertising”

Motivation:
Clicks are widely used as a proxy for ad effectiveness, but they are endogenous (correlated with unobserved user intent).
OLS estimates are biased; IV/2SLS requires strong instruments.

Empirical setup:
Dataset: demographics, ad features, clicks, conversions.

Instruments tested: Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Ad_Topic, Day_of_Week.
ML feature engineering attempted to strengthen instruments.

Findings:
First-stage F-statistics are weak.
Correlation between predicted and actual clicks is near zero.
Even with ML, instruments remain weak.

Conclusion: In practice, observational ad data struggles to support IV inference.

Contribution:
Demonstrates the empirical difficulty of finding strong instruments in digital ads.
Provides diagnostics (Stock–Yogo, Cragg–Donald) as a cautionary tale for applied researchers.

Part II: Conceptual Demonstration with Synthetic Data
Title idea: “Forecast Bias in Click-Based Measures: A Simulation Inspired by Chetty et al. (2014)”

Motivation:
Even if instruments were strong, are clicks unbiased forecasts of conversions?
Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education provides a template.

Synthetic design:
Generate data where clicks are endogenous to latent user interest.
Define ad “events” (e.g., placement/type changes) analogous to teacher turnover.
Compare forecasted conversions (based on clicks) to actual conversions.

Forecast bias test:
Calibration slope: regress actual conversions on predicted conversions.

Event-study validation: forecasted vs. realized changes when ad features shift.
Show systematic overprediction (e.g., flashy ads with high clicks but low conversions).

Findings:
OLS forecasts are biased (systematic misprediction).
2SLS forecasts correct bias when instruments are strong (in simulation).
Demonstrates how forecast bias manifests in ad settings.

Contribution:
Extends Chetty’s framework to digital advertising.
Provides a conceptual lens: clicks may mislead as forecasts, even beyond endogeneity.
Highlights the need for experimental variation in ad studies.

##############################################################################################################

Conclusion / Integration
Part I: Real-world ad data → instruments are weak, IV inference unreliable.

Part II: Synthetic data → forecast bias framework shows why clicks can mislead as forecasts.

Overall message:
Empirically: caution in using clicks as causal regressors.
Conceptually: clicks may suffer forecast bias, requiring better measures or experimental designs.
Managerial implication: don’t equate clicks with conversions; design studies to validate predictive measures.

🎯 Why this works
Part I grounds the paper in real data and shows the empirical challenge.
Part II elevates the paper by connecting to Chetty’s influential framework, even if synthetic.
Together, they tell a coherent story: “Clicks are endogenous and weakly instrumented in practice; conceptually,
they may also suffer forecast bias.”

Here’s how to map your study onto the sections of the Weber State template:

🔹 Title of Research Project
“Clicks, Instruments, and Forecast Bias: Evaluating Causal Inference in Digital Advertising” Keep it jargon-free but signal both empirical and conceptual depth.

🔹 Authors Line
Include your name, department, and any collaborators or advisors.

🔹 Introduction
Frame the problem and motivation:

Clicks are widely used to measure ad effectiveness.
But they’re endogenous and may mislead causal inference.

You explore this in two parts: real-world instrument diagnostics and a synthetic forecast bias simulation.

🔹 Research Goal
Split into two bullets:

Part I: Test whether ML-enhanced instruments can reliably identify causal effects of clicks on conversions.

Part II: Demonstrate how forecast bias can distort click-based predictions using synthetic data.

🔹 Methods
Divide into two sub-panels:

Part I: Real Data Instrument Diagnostics
Dataset: 9,543 ad impressions with demographics, ad features, clicks, conversions.

ML feature engineering to predict Clicks.
2SLS vs. OLS comparison using Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Ad_Topic, Day_of_Week as instruments.
Instrument strength diagnostics (F-stat, Cragg–Donald, correlation).

Part II: Synthetic Forecast Bias Simulation
Simulated ad cohorts with endogenous click behavior.

Forecast conversion rates using OLS and 2SLS.
Apply Chetty-style calibration slope and event-based validation.
Measure systematic misprediction (forecast bias).

🔹 Figures and Results
Use 3–4 visual panels:

First-stage diagnostics (real data):
Bar chart of F-statistics across models.
Scatter plot of Clicks vs. predicted Clicks (low correlation).

2SLS vs. OLS estimates (real data):
Coefficient comparison with confidence intervals.
Highlight instability due to weak instruments.

Forecast bias calibration (synthetic):
Plot: actual vs. predicted conversions across cohorts.
Show slope < 1 → overprediction.

Event-study panel (synthetic):
Forecasted vs. realized conversion changes when ad features switch.

🔹 Conclusion
Summarize each part:

Part I: ML-enhanced instruments are still weak in practice; causal inference from clicks is fragile.

Part II: Forecast bias can systematically distort click-based predictions, even with strong instruments.

Implication: Clicks are not just endogenous — they may be unreliable forecasters. Better instruments or 
experimental designs are needed.

🧾 Poster Abstract
Clicks, Instruments, and Forecast Bias: Evaluating Causal Inference in Digital Advertising

This study investigates the reliability of click-based measures in estimating and forecasting ad effectiveness. 
In Part I, we simulate ad impression data to compare Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
estimates of the causal effect of clicks on conversion rates. Using machine learning–engineered instruments derived
from ad features, we demonstrate that strong instruments can recover the true causal effect, while OLS suffers from 
endogeneity bias.

Part II: Forecast Bias in Click-Based Predictions Building on Raj Chetty’s (2014) forecast bias framework, we adapt the 
methodology to the advertising domain. Using synthetic data with a known causal structure, we examine whether 
click-based forecasts systematically mispredict conversion outcomes across ad configurations. Two validation exercises 
are conducted: (1) a calibration slope test, where OLS-based forecasts exhibit attenuation bias while 2SLS-based 
forecasts align more closely with the true causal effect; and (2) an event-style analysis, where simulated shocks to ad 
features reveal that OLS forecasts tend to overpredict conversion changes, while 2SLS forecasts reduce bias. Although 
the implementation is preliminary and subject to limitations, results suggest that instrumented approaches can correct 
systematic forecast bias in advertising contexts.

Together, these findings highlight the dual role of endogeneity: it distorts both causal inference and predictive 
validity. We conclude that clicks may be unreliable as forecasting measures unless instrumented properly, and we propose 
the forecast bias framework as a diagnostic tool for validating predictive metrics in digital advertising.



🟣 Introduction
Clicks are widely used to measure ad effectiveness, yet they are often endogenous — influenced by latent user intent and 
ad targeting. This endogeneity undermines causal inference and may distort predictions of conversion outcomes. Inspired 
by Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education, this study investigates whether clicks are reliable both as causal 
regressors and as forecasting tools in digital advertising.

🟣 Research Goal
Part I: Evaluate whether machine learning–enhanced instruments can recover the true causal effect of clicks on 
conversions using 2SLS.

Part II: Test whether click-based forecasts systematically mispredict conversion outcomes using Chetty-style validation 
techniques.

🟣 Methods
We simulate synthetic ad impression data with known causal structure:
Endogeneity: Clicks are influenced by latent user intent.
Instruments: Ad_Type × Ad_Placement combinations are used to predict clicks.
Outcome: Conversion_Rate is generated with a true causal effect of clicks.

Two models are fit:
OLS: Treats clicks as exogenous.
2SLS: Uses instruments to correct for endogeneity.

We apply two forecast bias diagnostics:
Calibration slope test: Regress actual conversion rates on predicted rates across ad cohorts.
Event-style validation: Simulate ad configuration “shocks” and compare forecasted vs. actual changes in conversion rates.

🟣 Figures and Results
Instrument strength: ML-enhanced instruments yield strong first-stage F-statistics.
Calibration slope:
OLS slope ≈ 0.32 → systematic overprediction.
2SLS slope ≈ 1.03 → unbiased forecasts.

Event-style validation:
OLS forecasts overshoot actual conversion changes.
2SLS forecasts align closely with observed outcomes.

These results demonstrate that 2SLS corrects both causal bias and forecast bias when instruments are strong.

🟣 Conclusion
This study shows that endogeneity in click data distorts both causal inference and predictive accuracy. While OLS overestimates conversion effects and mispredicts outcomes, 2SLS — when supported by strong instruments — recovers the true causal effect and produces calibrated forecasts. We adapt Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework to digital advertising, offering a diagnostic lens for validating predictive metrics in observational settings.

Ian Last Name¹, First Name Last Name², First Name Last Name³ ¹Department of Business Economics, ²Department of Integrative Biology, ³Department of Computer Science Weber State University

🟣 Introduction
Clicks are widely used to measure ad effectiveness, but they’re often endogenous — shaped by user intent and targeting. This undermines causal inference and may distort predictions. 
Inspired by Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education, we test whether clicks are reliable for both causal estimation and forecasting in digital advertising.

🟣 Research Goal
Part I: Estimate the causal effect of clicks on conversions using machine learning–enhanced instruments and 2SLS.

Part II: Diagnose forecast bias in click-based predictions using Chetty-style calibration and event-style validation.

🟣 Methods
We simulate synthetic ad impression data with known causal structure inspired by the original dataset:

Endogeneity: Clicks are influenced by latent user intent.
Instruments: Ad_Type × Ad_Placement combinations predict clicks.
Outcome: Conversion_Rate is generated with a true causal effect of clicks.

Two models are fit:

OLS: Treats clicks as exogenous.
2SLS: Uses instruments to correct for endogeneity.

Forecast bias diagnostics:

Calibration slope test: Regress actual conversion rates on predicted rates across ad cohorts.
Event-style validation: Simulate ad configuration “shocks” and compare forecasted vs. actual changes.

🟣 Figures and Results

🟣 Conclusion
Endogeneity in click data distorts both causal inference and predictive accuracy. OLS overestimates conversion effects and mispredicts outcomes. 2SLS — when supported by strong instruments — recovers the true causal 
effect and produces calibrated forecasts. We adapt Raj Chetty’s forecast bias framework to digital advertising, offering a diagnostic lens for validating predictive metrics in observational settings.

Figures and Results Part 2:
“The calibration plot shows whether OLS and 2SLS forecasts are systematically biased across cohorts
 in the cross‑section. The event‑style validation goes further, simulating a shock to test whether 
 forecasts remain reliable under change. Both measure forecast bias, but calibration is static 
 while event validation is dynamic — together they mirror Chetty’s 2014 reliability framework of 
 subgroup calibration and event study validation.”
