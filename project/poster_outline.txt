Part I: Empirical Limits with Real Data
Title idea: “The Endogeneity of Clicks: Limits of Instrumental Variable Approaches in Digital Advertising”

Motivation:
Clicks are widely used as a proxy for ad effectiveness, but they are endogenous (correlated with unobserved user intent).
OLS estimates are biased; IV/2SLS requires strong instruments.

Empirical setup:
Dataset: demographics, ad features, clicks, conversions.

Instruments tested: Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Ad_Topic, Day_of_Week.
ML feature engineering attempted to strengthen instruments.

Findings:
First-stage F-statistics are weak.
Correlation between predicted and actual clicks is near zero.
Even with ML, instruments remain weak.

Conclusion: In practice, observational ad data struggles to support IV inference.

Contribution:
Demonstrates the empirical difficulty of finding strong instruments in digital ads.
Provides diagnostics (Stock–Yogo, Cragg–Donald) as a cautionary tale for applied researchers.

Part II: Conceptual Demonstration with Synthetic Data
Title idea: “Forecast Bias in Click-Based Measures: A Simulation Inspired by Chetty et al. (2014)”

Motivation:
Even if instruments were strong, are clicks unbiased forecasts of conversions?
Chetty’s forecast bias framework in education provides a template.

Synthetic design:
Generate data where clicks are endogenous to latent user interest.
Define ad “events” (e.g., placement/type changes) analogous to teacher turnover.
Compare forecasted conversions (based on clicks) to actual conversions.

Forecast bias test:
Calibration slope: regress actual conversions on predicted conversions.

Event-study validation: forecasted vs. realized changes when ad features shift.
Show systematic overprediction (e.g., flashy ads with high clicks but low conversions).

Findings:
OLS forecasts are biased (systematic misprediction).
2SLS forecasts correct bias when instruments are strong (in simulation).
Demonstrates how forecast bias manifests in ad settings.

Contribution:
Extends Chetty’s framework to digital advertising.
Provides a conceptual lens: clicks may mislead as forecasts, even beyond endogeneity.
Highlights the need for experimental variation in ad studies.

Conclusion / Integration
Part I: Real-world ad data → instruments are weak, IV inference unreliable.

Part II: Synthetic data → forecast bias framework shows why clicks can mislead as forecasts.

Overall message:
Empirically: caution in using clicks as causal regressors.
Conceptually: clicks may suffer forecast bias, requiring better measures or experimental designs.
Managerial implication: don’t equate clicks with conversions; design studies to validate predictive measures.

🎯 Why this works
Part I grounds the paper in real data and shows the empirical challenge.
Part II elevates the paper by connecting to Chetty’s influential framework, even if synthetic.
Together, they tell a coherent story: “Clicks are endogenous and weakly instrumented in practice; conceptually,
they may also suffer forecast bias.”

🧩 Poster Layout Strategy for Your Two-Part Study
Here’s how to map your study onto the sections of the Weber State template:

🔹 Title of Research Project
“Clicks, Instruments, and Forecast Bias: Evaluating Causal Inference in Digital Advertising” Keep it jargon-free but signal both empirical and conceptual depth.

🔹 Authors Line
Include your name, department, and any collaborators or advisors.

🔹 Introduction
Frame the problem and motivation:

Clicks are widely used to measure ad effectiveness.
But they’re endogenous and may mislead causal inference.

You explore this in two parts: real-world instrument diagnostics and a synthetic forecast bias simulation.

🔹 Research Goal
Split into two bullets:

Part I: Test whether ML-enhanced instruments can reliably identify causal effects of clicks on conversions.

Part II: Demonstrate how forecast bias can distort click-based predictions using synthetic data.

🔹 Methods
Divide into two sub-panels:

Part I: Real Data Instrument Diagnostics
Dataset: 9,543 ad impressions with demographics, ad features, clicks, conversions.

ML feature engineering to predict Clicks.
2SLS vs. OLS comparison using Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Ad_Topic, Day_of_Week as instruments.
Instrument strength diagnostics (F-stat, Cragg–Donald, correlation).

Part II: Synthetic Forecast Bias Simulation
Simulated ad cohorts with endogenous click behavior.

Forecast conversion rates using OLS and 2SLS.
Apply Chetty-style calibration slope and event-based validation.
Measure systematic misprediction (forecast bias).

🔹 Figures and Results
Use 3–4 visual panels:

First-stage diagnostics (real data):
Bar chart of F-statistics across models.
Scatter plot of Clicks vs. predicted Clicks (low correlation).

2SLS vs. OLS estimates (real data):
Coefficient comparison with confidence intervals.
Highlight instability due to weak instruments.

Forecast bias calibration (synthetic):
Plot: actual vs. predicted conversions across cohorts.
Show slope < 1 → overprediction.

Event-study panel (synthetic):
Forecasted vs. realized conversion changes when ad features switch.

🔹 Conclusion
Summarize each part:

Part I: ML-enhanced instruments are still weak in practice; causal inference from clicks is fragile.

Part II: Forecast bias can systematically distort click-based predictions, even with strong instruments.

Implication: Clicks are not just endogenous — they may be unreliable forecasters. Better instruments or 
experimental designs are needed.
