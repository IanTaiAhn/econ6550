Hello Professor,

As I've been working on this project I have learned a lot and discovered many things about my dataset.
Firstly, my assumption that "Clicks" is endogenous is true, and I've successfully stacked random forest, xgbooster, and gradient boosting
to create an instrument from "Clicks". However, the instrument was super weak, and I even added 20+ interaction terms,
(income x age, age x ad_topic, etc..) and the instrument strenght was still less than 5. So, I then tried generating synthetic data
and this made the instrument useable for 2SLS. So I'm at this point where I did have some code written that utilized Raj Chetty's 2014
methodologies for correcting forecast bias from value added estimates by using lagged variables and such, but I don't know if It
is even feasible due to my weak instruments.


AM I COPING OUT? HOW ELSE CAN I INCREASE INSTRUMENT STRENGHT?
