Hello Professor,

As I've been working on this project I have learned a lot and discovered many things about my dataset.
Firstly, my assumption that "Clicks" is endogenous is true, and I've successfully stacked random forest, xgbooster, and gradient boosting
to create an instrument from "Clicks". However, the instrument was super weak, and I even added 20+ interaction terms,
(income x age, age x ad_topic, etc..) and the instrument strenght was still less than 5. So, I then tried generating synthetic data
and this made the instrument useable for 2SLS. So I'm at this point where I did have some code written that utilized Raj Chetty's 2014
methodologies for correcting forecast bias from value added estimates by using lagged variables and such, but I don't know if It
is even feasible due to my weak instruments.


AM I COPING OUT? HOW ELSE CAN I INCREASE INSTRUMENT STRENGHT?

Hello Professor,

As I've been working through the problem I wanted to answer <causal ad effect ml engineered iv for 2sls> I found that the
data I have bee..
What if I found another dataset? Is it too late? Funk

Hello Professor,

I'm learning a lot while working on this project, and I've hit a crossroads of sorts. I found my feature engineered instrument 
is rather weak, and this sort of derails my end goal integrating Raj Chetty's forecast bias from value-added estimates.
So, the real data I have suffers from too much noise and so I thought I could try to generate my own data from the same columns
in the dataset and I was able to create a strong instrument that way.

🚀 How to Test Forecast Bias in Ads
You can adapt Chetty’s empirical strategy:

First stage: Predict conversions from clicks (like VA predicting outcomes).
Forecast bias test:
Compare predicted conversion rates with actual conversion rates when ad characteristics 
change (e.g., new Ad_Type or Ad_Placement).
If predictions consistently overshoot or undershoot, you’ve got forecast bias.

Instrumental angle:
Use exogenous ad features (Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Day_of_Week) as instruments for clicks.
Then check whether the IV-predicted clicks yield unbiased forecasts of conversion.

✅ Feasibility
Yes, feasible. You can integrate forecast bias testing into your ad pipeline.
It’s essentially asking: Are clicks a reliable predictor of conversions, or do they mislead us?
This is highly relevant because in digital ads, clicks often don’t map cleanly to conversions — just 
like raw test scores don’t perfectly map to long-term student outcomes.

You’ve diagnosed the problem exactly: Clicks is too noisy to serve as a strong endogenous regressor in your IV setup. Your first-stage R² ≈ 0, partial F-stat ≈ 0.77, and correlation(Clicks, Clicks_hat) ≈ 0.026 all scream weak instrument. That means the 2SLS estimates are unreliable, and pushing harder on this exact specification won’t fix it.

The good news is you don’t have to throw away the dataset — you can pivot the research question to something that’s still meaningful and feasible with the variables you have.

🔎 Why Clicks fails as an instrument
High variance, low signal: Individual click counts are driven by unobserved user intent, randomness, and noise.

Features don’t explain much: Ad_Type, Placement, Topic, Day_of_Week barely move Clicks in your sample.

Endogeneity baked in: Clicks are endogenous precisely because they reflect latent interest, so predicting them with ad metadata doesn’t generate exogenous variation.

🚀 Pivot Options With Your Dataset
1. Treat Clicks as the outcome, not the instrument
Instead of asking “Do clicks cause conversions?”, ask “What drives clicks?”.

Model Clicks directly as the dependent variable, using Ad_Type, Ad_Placement, Ad_Topic, demographics, and time.

This gives you ad engagement analysis: which ad features generate more clicks, controlling for user heterogeneity.

2. Use Conversion Rate as the outcome, with ad features as regressors
Drop Clicks from the IV setup.

Estimate:
This gives you direct causal estimates of ad design on conversion, assuming exogeneity of ad assignment.

If ad assignment is randomized (or plausibly exogenous), this is stronger than noisy IV.

3. Interaction effects and heterogeneity
Explore whether Ad_Type × Ad_Placement or Ad_Topic × Demographics drive differences in conversion.

This shifts the question to “Which combinations of ad features work best for which audiences?”.

4. Forecast bias test (Chetty analogy)
Treat Clicks as a noisy predictor of Conversion.

Test whether Clicks systematically over- or under-predict Conversion across ad types or placements.

This reframes the study as “Are clicks a reliable forecast of conversion?” rather than “Do clicks cause conversion?”.

Much more feasible given your weak instrument problem.

5. Descriptive / predictive pivot
Use ML models to predict Conversion directly from ad features + demographics.

Compare predictive accuracy with and without Clicks.

This answers “Does including clicks improve conversion prediction?” — a practical business question.

✅ Recommended Pivot
Given your diagnostics, the most promising pivot is:

Drop 2SLS with Clicks as endogenous.

Use ad features (Type, Placement, Topic, Day_of_Week) as the main explanatory variables for Conversion Rate.

Frame the study as: “Which ad characteristics drive conversions, and are clicks a reliable forecast of conversion outcomes?”.

This way, you still leverage the dataset, but you avoid the weak instrument trap.

👉 Would you like me to sketch a new regression design (without IV) that directly estimates the effect of ad features on Conversion Rate, plus a side test for forecast bias (Clicks → Conversion)? That would give you a clean pivot path.
