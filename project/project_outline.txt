ðŸ“Œ Project Title
Causal Impact of Online Ads on User Click Behavior: A Study Using OLS and Instrumental Variables

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Estimate the effect of ad characteristics on click-through rates (CTR)

Identify and address endogeneity in ad targeting

Apply instrumental variable techniques to uncover causal relationships

Compare traditional econometric methods with machine learning-based causal inference

ðŸ§± Dataset Overview
Source: Mendeley Data â€“ DOI: 10.17632/wrvjmdtjd9.1 Features:

User demographics: age, gender, income, location

Ad features: type, topic, placement

Behavior: clicks, conversions, timestamps

Context: device type, time of day, day of week

ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize CTR by ad type, user demographics, and time of day

Identify patterns and potential confounders

2. OLS Regression
Model: CTR ~ AdType + Topic + Placement + UserFeatures

Evaluate coefficients and goodness-of-fit

Discuss limitations due to potential endogeneity

3. Diagnosing Endogeneity
Hypothesize that ad targeting may be biased (e.g., high-income users get more engaging ads)

Use correlation analysis and residual plots to detect bias

4. Instrumental Variables (IV)
Identify potential instruments:

Time of day (ads shown randomly at different times)

Device type (ad format may vary by device but not user intent)

Apply IV regression: CTR ~ AdFeatures | Instruments

Compare IV estimates to OLS

5. Advanced Causal Methods (Optional)
Use Double Machine Learning (via EconML) or Causal Forests to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects

Compare predictive vs. causal performance

6. Validation and Interpretation
Cross-validate models

Interpret coefficients and causal effects

Discuss business implications (e.g., which ad types truly drive clicks?)

ðŸ“ˆ Deliverables
