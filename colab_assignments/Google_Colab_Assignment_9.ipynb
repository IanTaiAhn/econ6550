    "Then the next part $\\forall t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi < 0$ translates to for all t, or every time point our $\\phi$ is negative. This allows us to expect mean-reverting or oscillatory behavior. What that means is that the first order AR function will settle around a stable mean. This is important because when we combine this rule with our expectation formula under the assumption of stationarity, there will be a stable long-run mean. Why do we care about this? It ensures our model is more stable, interpretable, and the forecasts are more reliable.\n",
